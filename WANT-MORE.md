# Want More Puzzles? 📚
> Thanks for trying these scope puzzles! Glad you made it through all 10! 🎉

## Here's the Thing...
I'm a CS student in Ireland who struggled HARD with scope concepts because my lecturer's teaching style just didn't click for me.

So I taught myself by creating these puzzles. Turns out, making them helped me understand scope better than any lecture ever did!

Now I'm wondering: Would other people find this helpful too?

## What I'm Thinking of Building
If there's enough interest, I'd love to create a complete scope puzzle workbook with:

### 📊 Content
- 100+ problems across all difficulty levels
- Progressive difficulty that builds real mastery
- Detailed explanations for every single problem
- More complex scenarios: nested functions, closures, mixed concepts
- Bonus section: Pass-by-value vs pass-by-reference puzzles
- Challenge problems: combining multiple concepts

### 📱 Formats (maybe!)
- PDF workbook (printable, works offline)
- Interactive web version (instant feedback as you solve)
- Anki/flashcard deck (spaced repetition)
- Video explanations for the trickiest problems

## But First... I Need YOUR Feedback!
Before I spend months making this, I need to know if it's actually useful!

## Please tell me:

2. **What difficulty felt right? Too easy? Too hard?**
3. **What was confusing or unclear?**
4. **Would you pay for a full version? If yes, what's a fair price?**
    - $5? $10? $15? Something else?
5. **What other topics would you want puzzles for?**
    - Closures? Memory management? Recursion? Pointers?

## Seriously Though... Please Give Feedback!
I put a bunch of work into these 10 puzzles, but I'll only make 90 more if people actually find them useful.

Even if you hated them, tell me why! That's valuable too.

5 minutes of your feedback = hours of my time saved if this is a bad idea!

## Thank You! 🙏
Whether you solve 1 puzzle or all 10, you're learning. That's what matters.

If these helped even a little bit, I'm happy.

Good luck with your studies! 🍀
